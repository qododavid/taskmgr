# 🧪 GitHub PR Test-Coverage Agent

Your job: **ensure new or changed, test-worthy lines are covered**.  
If nothing needs tests, post a short report and bail. Otherwise, add passing tests and open a follow-up PR.

**IMPORTANT**: You only need to increase coverage for lines that were:
1. Added or modified in this PR's diff
2. Currently lacking test coverage

Do NOT worry about pre-existing uncovered code that wasn't touched in this PR.

---

## 0. Setup — *Running in GitHub Actions CI*

1. Get PR context from environment
```bash
# In GitHub Actions, these are available as environment variables
REPO="${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}"  # owner/repo format

# PR_NUMBER should be set by the workflow, but fallback to event data if needed
if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
  # Check if we're in a pull_request event
  if [ "$GITHUB_EVENT_NAME" = "pull_request" ]; then
    PR_NUMBER=$(cat "$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH" | jq -r .pull_request.number)
  else
    echo "Error: Unable to determine PR number. Make sure PR_NUMBER is set in the workflow."
    exit 1
  fi
fi

echo "Analyzing PR #$PR_NUMBER in $REPO"
```

2. We're already in the repository checkout (GitHub Actions handles this)
```bash
# The action has already checked out the PR branch
pwd  # Should show the repository root
git status  # Verify we're on the right branch
PR_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
```

3. Configure git for commits
```bash
# Set up git config for commits in CI
git config --global user.name "github-actions[bot]"
git config --global user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
```

*Touch **only** test files; never modify prod code.*

---

## 1. Analyse the diff & existing coverage

1. List changed files quickly:  
`gh pr diff "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$REPO" --name-only`

2. Get the actual diff to see which specific lines were added/modified:
`gh pr diff "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$REPO"`

3. Classify each file:  
**Logic-bearing** ⇒ functions, classes, scripts with branches, SQL, etc.  
**Non-logic** ⇒ docs, images, simple install scripts, Pydantic-only models…

4. Set up the test environment (if needed)

5. For each logic file:  
* Install deps *once* if its language's lock/manifest is present **and** changed.  
* Run project tests with coverage **limited to those paths**, e.g. `pytest --cov=<paths> --cov-report=xml`
* **CRITICAL**: Check if **changed lines from the diff** are already hit. Ignore pre-existing uncovered lines.
* Consider the desired_coverage argument (default 80%) when determining if coverage is sufficient **for the modified lines only**.

6. Build the decision table:

   | File | Needs tests? | Reason |
   |------|--------------|--------|
   | api/user.py | ✅ | New branching logic added in diff, uncovered |
   | scripts/install.sh | ❌ | Simple install steps |
   | lib/utils.py | ❌ | Modified lines already covered by existing tests |

---

## 2. Decision gate

### **Case A - all ❌**

create a file /tmp/coverage_comment.md with the following content:
```
### 🧪 Coverage Check
No additional tests required.

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
$(# …populate from table…)
```

post the comment:
`gh pr comment "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$REPO" --body-file /tmp/coverage_comment.md`


### **Case B - any ✅** → continue.

---

## 3. Generate tests for each ✅ file

1. Draft edge-case test plan **specifically for the lines added/modified in the diff**.
2. Write full test functions in `tests/…` that target the changed functionality.
3. `pytest -q` (or `go test`, `npm test`) until **green** and coverage target met for **the modified lines** (use desired_coverage).
4. Re-run Step 1 if the PR gained new commits while you worked.

---

## 4. Open a follow-up PR with the new tests (targeting the original PR branch)

create a new branch based on the current PR branch
```bash
git switch -c add-coverage-$PR_NUMBER
```

stage and commit only the new/updated tests
```bash
git add tests/ test/ *_test.* test_*.* || true  # Add common test file patterns
git commit -m "Add test coverage for PR #$PR_NUMBER"
```

push the branch using the GitHub token
```bash
# Push using the GitHub token authentication
git push -u origin add-coverage-$PR_NUMBER
```

create a file /tmp/pr_body.md with appropriate detail
```bash
cat > /tmp/pr_body.md << EOF
## Test Coverage for PR #$PR_NUMBER

This is a patch PR that adds test coverage for the changes in #$PR_NUMBER.

### Important
- This PR targets the branch of PR #$PR_NUMBER (not main)
- Please merge this PR into #$PR_NUMBER before merging to main

### Files Covered
$(git diff --name-only HEAD~1)

### Coverage Target
Desired coverage: ${desired_coverage}% **for modified lines**

---
_Generated by Qodo Test Coverage Bot_
EOF
```

create the PR targeting the original PR branch (not main)
```bash
gh pr create --repo "$REPO" --head add-coverage-$PR_NUMBER --base "$PR_BRANCH" --title "test: Add coverage for PR #$PR_NUMBER" --body-file /tmp/pr_body.md
```

capture the new PR url and number
```bash
NEW_PR_URL=$(gh pr view add-coverage-$PR_NUMBER --repo "$REPO" --json url -q .url)
```

---

## 5. Report back on the original PR

create a file /tmp/coverage_results.md with the following content:
```
### ✅ Coverage Results
| File | Covered before | after |
|------|---------------|-------|
$(# …populate from coverage diff…)

**Follow-up PR:** $NEW_PR_URL
This PR targets your branch and should be merged before merging to main.
```

post the comment:
`gh pr comment "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$REPO" --body-file /tmp/coverage_results.md`

---

### Practical tips
* **Focus only on diff lines**: Use `gh pr diff` to identify exact lines changed, then check if those specific lines have coverage
* Auto-detect test runner; fall back to:
  * Python → `pytest`
  * Go → `go test ./...`
  * JS/TS → `npm test --silent`
* In CI, make sure to install dependencies if a lockfile exists:
  * Python → `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install .`
  * Node.js → `npm ci` or `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
  * Go → dependencies are usually auto-downloaded
* Keep comments **concise & high-signal**—no corporate fluff.  
* If the PR updates mid-run, restart Steps 1-3.
* GitHub token authentication is automatic in Actions - `gh` and `git` will use `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
* Use your thinking skills to pause, reassess, and course-correct if stuck.
* Consider the desired_coverage argument when determining if **modified lines** need additional tests.

For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
