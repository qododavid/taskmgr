# Task Manager CLI

This repository provides a simple command-line task manager application written in Go. It manages tasks with basic operations like adding and listing them, and marking tasks as done. Itâ€™s organized into multiple packages and includes test coverage reporting in Cobertura format.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.23+ (or a fairly recent version of Go)
- `gocover-cobertura` tool for Cobertura coverage conversion

## Installation

Make sure you have Go and `gocover-cobertura` installed:

```bash
go install github.com/t-yuki/gocover-cobertura@latest
```

## Building

To build the `taskmgr` binary:

```bash
go build ./cmd/taskmgr
```

This will create a `taskmgr` executable in the current directory.

## Usage

```bash
./taskmgr [command] [arguments]
```

### Commands

- `add <title>`: Adds a new task with the given title.
- `list`: Lists all tasks.
- `done <index>`: Marks the task at `<index>` as done.

Example:

```bash
./taskmgr add "Buy milk"
./taskmgr list
./taskmgr done 0
```

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

## Generating Coverage Report

To generate a Cobertura format coverage report:

```bash
go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out && gocover-cobertura < coverage.out > coverage.xml
```

This creates `coverage.xml` which you can use with CI tools that support Cobertura reports.
